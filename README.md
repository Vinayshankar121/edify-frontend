# Edify School Hub

The current frontend is a Vite/React application that uses the Edify backend API for authentication and school data. Start the backend and PostgreSQL by following `../backend/README.md`, then run `npm install` and `npm run dev` from this directory. Set `VITE_API_URL` to the backend's `/api` URL when it differs from `http://localhost:4000/api`.

The design brief below is historical and describes an earlier localStorage-only prototype; it is not an accurate description of the current persistence or authentication model.

Complete prompt

Build a complete, modern, professional School Management & Fee Management System frontend for:

EDIFY SCHOOL
THINKBEYOND

IMPORTANT:
This is FRONTEND ONLY.

Technology requirements:
- React.js
- Vite
- JavaScript and JSX only
- TanStack Router
- Tailwind CSS
- Lucide React icons
- LocalStorage for all data persistence
- No backend
- No Supabase
- No Firebase
- No API calls
- No database
- No authentication server

The application must work completely using browser LocalStorage so that the entire frontend can be demonstrated without a backend.

==================================================
1. BRANDING
==================================================

Use the uploaded Edify School logo as the main branding reference.

Brand:
EDIFY SCHOOL
THIKKONDA

Use the colors from the logo as the primary visual identity:
- Orange as the primary accent
- Black / very dark charcoal for primary text
- White for clean backgrounds
- Light gray for secondary backgrounds
- Use subtle orange variations for hover, active, focus and highlights.

Do NOT use the previous red/black TechMinds color scheme.

The website must visually feel like a premium modern school management platform.

Typography:
- Use a modern sans-serif font throughout the application.
- Prefer "Inter", "Manrope", or a similar professional sans-serif.
- No serif fonts.
- No handwritten fonts.
- No decorative fonts.
- Headings should be strong and clean.
- Body text should be highly readable.

==================================================
2. DESIGN DIRECTION

If appropriate, use Framer Motion.

==================================================
4. APPLICATION STRUCTURE
==================================================

Create two different user experiences:

1. SUPER ADMIN
2. CASHIER

The Super Admin has complete control.

The Cashier has a restricted dashboard and only access to cashier-related functionality.

==================================================
5. LOGIN SYSTEM
==================================================

Create a professional Edify School login page.

Login screen:
- Edify School logo
- "School Management System"
- Email/Username
- Password
- Show/hide password
- Remember me

- Forgot password UI
- Professional school-themed illustration or subtle background
- Responsive mobile design

Authentication must be simulated using LocalStorage.

Create demo users:

Super Admin:
username: admin
password: admin123

Cashier:
username: cashier
password: cashier123

DO NOT expose passwords unnecessarily inside the UI.

After login:
- Store authenticated user in LocalStorage.
- Redirect according to role.

==================================================
6. ROLE-BASED ACCESS
==================================================

SUPER ADMIN:

Full access to:
- Dashboard

==================================================

The Super Admin must be able to create cashier accounts.

Create:

Cashier Management

Features:

22. LOCAL STORAGE DATA ARCHITECTURE
==================================================

Create a clean LocalStorage architecture.

Use keys such as:

edify_auth

edify_parents
edify_classes
edify_sections

For cashier:

Show cashier name and "Cashier" role.

For admin:

Show admin name and "Super Admin" role.

==================================================
26. RESPONSIVE DESIGN
==================================================

This is extremely important.

Desktop:
- Full sidebar
- Large dashboard
- Tables

Tablet:
- Collapsible sidebar
- Responsive cards

Mobile:
- Drawer navigation
- Stacked cards
- Horizontal scrolling only where absolutely necessary
- Tables should transform into cards where practical
- Forms should use one-column layout
- Buttons should remain easily tappable
- Dashboard statistics should stack properly

Test the application at:
- 1440px
- 1280px
- 1024px
- 768px
- 480px
- 375px

==================================================
27. UX DETAILS
==================================================

Add:
- Toast notifications
- Confirmation dialogs
- Loading states
- Empty states
- Error states
- Form validation
- Success states
- Search debounce where appropriate
- Keyboard-friendly forms
- Accessible labels
- Focus states

Examples:

After adding student:

"Student successfully admitted."

After payment:

"Payment collected successfully. Receipt #ED-2026-0001 generated."

After cashier creation:

"Cashier account created successfully."

==================================================
28. SECURITY SIMULATION
==================================================

This is a frontend-only project, so this is NOT real authentication.

Implement role-based access only as a frontend demonstration using LocalStorage.

Clearly structure the code so a real backend/JWT authentication system can replace it later.

Do not claim that LocalStorage authentication is production security.

==================================================
29. CODE QUALITY
==================================================

Use a clean component architecture.

Suggested structure:

src/
  components/
  layouts/
  pages/
    auth/
    admin/
    cashier/
    students/
    admissions/
    fees/
    reports/
    settings/
  routes/
  hooks/
  utils/
  services/
  data/
  context/
  assets/

Create reusable components:

Button
Input
Select
Modal
Table
Badge
Card
StatCard
SearchBar
DatePicker
Pagination
Toast
ConfirmDialog
EmptyState
PageHeader
FormSection
LoadingSpinner

Avoid putting everything into one large component.

==================================================
30. IMPORTANT IMPLEMENTATION RULES
==================================================

- Do not build a backend.
- Do not use Supabase.
- Do not use Firebase.
- Do not use external APIs.
- Use LocalStorage only.
- Do not change the Edify School branding.
- Use the uploaded Edify School logo.
- Use the logo's orange, black and white color identity.
- Use professional sans-serif typography.
- Keep the UI consistent across every page.
- Admin and Cashier dashboards must be visually and functionally different.
- Admin must control Cashier account creation/access.
- Cashier must only access permitted modules.
- All CRUD operations must persist after browser refresh.
- Do not lose LocalStorage data on refresh.
- Do not overwrite existing data when initializing demo data.
- Use realistic school data.
- Make the application production-quality from a UI/UX perspective even though the data layer is LocalStorage.
- Do not add unnecessary modules that are not required by the provided requirements.

==================================================
31. FINAL TESTING
==================================================

Before finishing:

1. Run the project.
2. Verify login.
3. Verify Super Admin dashboard.
4. Verify Cashier dashboard.
5. Verify admin can create cashier.
6. Verify cashier login.
7. Verify unauthorized cashier routes are blocked.
8. Add a student.
9. Refresh browser.
10. Confirm student still exists.
11. Create a fee structure.
12. Collect a payment.
13. Generate receipt.
14. Refresh browser.
15. Confirm payment and receipt still exist.
16. Reprint receipt.
17. Test search and filters.
18. Test reports.
19. Test academic year.
20. Test responsive design.
21. Check console for errors.
22. Fix all build/runtime errors.
23. Make sure `npm run build` succeeds.

IMPORTANT FINAL REQUIREMENT:

Do not create a generic school admin template.

Create a unique, premium, professional school management experience specifically designed for EDIFY SCHOOL THIKKONDA.

The final interface should look like a real commercial school management product that a school could confidently demonstrate to administrators and cashiers.

One important architectural decision

For this particular project, LocalStorage is fine for the frontend prototype/demo, but don't present it as production-grade security or multi-user storage. If the school later wants multiple computers/cashiers using the same live data simultaneously, you'll need a backend/database.

For now, your flow can be:

React + LocalStorage â†’ build â†’ deploy frontend â†’ demonstrate to Edify School.

The quotation itself specifies the system as a web application for a single school, with Super Admin and Cashier roles, so this prompt keeps the implementation focused instead of turning it into the larger multi-school ERP you have worked on previously.

## Development

Install dependencies and start the app locally:

```sh
npm install
npm run dev
```

Create a production build with `npm run build` and serve it locally with `npm run preview`.
